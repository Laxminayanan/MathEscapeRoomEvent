# MathEscapeRoom
- Math Escape Room is a hybrid digital-physical event where teams compete to solve Aptitude Questions within a time constraint. The Console Based Program manages the complete workflow from team registration to question delivery, response tracking, and result compilation. This system was successfully deployed during our college's Tech Fest, providing participants with an engaging and challenging experience.


# üîÑ Event Flow
- Registration: Teams of 3-5 participants arrive at the venue and register their team details.
- Device Submission: Participants submit their electronic gadgets to prevent unfair advantages.
- Clue Distribution: One team member randomly selects a clue/riddle from a transparent jar.
- Treasure Hunt: The team decodes the clue to find a specific numbered plastic ball hidden somewhere Within the campus.
- Time Constraint: Teams must return with the correct treasure number within 15 minutes or face elimination.
- Digital Challenge: Qualifying teams proceed to a computer station where they:

Enter their credentials
Input the found treasure number
Access a unique set of math problems tied to their treasure number
Solve the problems while the system tracks time and responses


Results: Upon completion, the system:

Generates an Excel file with detailed performance metrics
Automatically emails the results to the team using their registered email address
